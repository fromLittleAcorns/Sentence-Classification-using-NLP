# Sentence-Classification-using-NLP
Machine learning algorithms to look at the use of NLP for sentence classification

The files in this folder are an attempt to use NLP technicaues to classify sentances

The first simple approach is in the Jupyter notebook: Sentence classification using simple bag of words regression.ipyt

This uses a very simple approach without any word vectors and as would be expected does not yield very good results.  I'm sure these could be improved to some extent by tweaking word replacement and stemming, however, I am going to put my efforts into now looking at an approach that starts with word vectors, which should be much better
